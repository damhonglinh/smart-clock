# smart-clock
My personal Arduino project as well as an Arduino learning playground.

There are a few variants subprojects in this repo but all are to make a simple digital clock plus some interesting information.
Some interesting information can be a quote changing every n hours, fetch from Internet; or current tempurature from
either/both Internet or sensor; or some advanced data fetched from serverless AWS Iot.

I finished some of above subprojects and found not useful anymore. Some are useful but too time consuming at my level so I 
stopped. Though, there is one that is simple and useful enough that I am still using one everyday in my room.
